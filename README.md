3. We took the following assumption while building our application as it was a bit ambiguous. 

For any user, if a user watches a movie at a particular time say 2 O-clock in the afternoon today. 
No matter how many times he watches between 2 today and 1 : 59 tomorrow (23.59 hours) it is only counted as 1. 
But if he plays at 3 tomorrow, 24 hours from that point is considered. In conclusion, between any 24 hour interval
there is only one per user per movie.

4. Build instructions:
   a. Run the Spring back using run command in eclipse.
   b. Run 
   c. Run react front end by going into movie-central/Frontend run npm install and after dependencies are installed run: npm start
